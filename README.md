# New_Year_Project by jpsuertee

Objective: The purpose of this project is to learn and produce a simple CRUD -create, read, update, and delete- program using Python's Flask framework, which was used to make an API between a web application and SQLite database. 
           
Summary: I produced a web app that enables users to record their New Year's resolutions on the website along with their steps to achieve their goals. Features include updating and deleting user goals. 

Methods: 
    1. Installed Python's Flask and SQLAlchemy
    2. Created a simple HTML/CSS web page for users to interact and insert data.
    3. Wrote python functions using flask to manipulate data entries that would connect to the HTML webpage.
    4. Began learning how to use Git in VSCODE and pushed files into Github
