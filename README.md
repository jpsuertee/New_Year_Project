# New_Year_Project by jpsuertee

Objective: The purpose of this project is to learn and produce a simple CRUD -create, read, update, and delete- program using Python's Flask framework, which was used to make an API between a web application and SQLite database. This project also enabled me to learn how to navigate and create respositories on Github.
           
Summary: I produced a web app that enables users to record their New Year's resolutions on the website along with their steps to achieve their goals. Features include updating and deleting user resolutions and steps. 

Methods: I installed Python's Flask and SQLAlchemy modules and used a virtual environment to test my we application. I first created a basic HTML website that would interact with users, enabling them to insert their New Years resolutions. Then, I created API functions using python and flask- to connect with the localhost and web pages- to upload user resolutions into a SQLite database. This data would then be displayed, along with user name and data, on the main page. 
Furthermore, I created functions to remove and update data entries. Using these methods that I have learned, I produced additional features such as the steps that a user wanted to accomplish in order to achieve their New Years Resolution. Finally, I pushed my files onto Github and uploaded the project on a Heroku server. 

Conclusion: This introduction to the back-end field has pushed my curiosity to learn even more techniques and technologies. Next, I would love to learn how to use online data and to create REST API's in order to produce a website of my interest.
